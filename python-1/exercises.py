data = [6, 8, 3, 5, 9, 10]

names = {"dog": "peanut", "cat": "willow", "lizard": "rodney",
	"giraffe": "rose", "whale": "whisper"}

# Exercise 1: Can you write a function that prints every other element of data:
# Correct output: 6, 3, 9
def ex1():
	pass

# Exercise 2: Write a function that prints the types of animals with 
# 	      names that start with "w"
# Correct output: "cat", "whale"
def ex2():
	pass

# Final Exercise: Write a main() function which calls the other exercise functions and
#                 the final 2 lines to execute the function when the file is run
